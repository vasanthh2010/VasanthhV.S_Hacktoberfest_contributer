# 🎵 Sound Event Detection (Clap & Whistle)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **advanced Python-based Sound Event Detection System** designed to identify specific audio cues — such as **claps** and **whistles** — using **audio signal processing** and **machine learning techniques**.  
It showcases **real-time detection** using your device’s microphone or pre-recorded audio files.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect **clap** and **whistle** sound events from live or recorded audio.  
- Use **audio feature extraction** techniques such as MFCCs and spectrograms.  
- Optionally train a **machine learning model** to classify different sound patterns.  
- Demonstrate **real-time sound event detection** with Python.
